# DEXterity: Smart Financial Instruments
v.0.0.2

## Project idea
Smart contract infrastructure for permissionless creation and submission of financial instruments into decentralized token exchange platforms like IDEX and Ether Delta.

Ethereum developers should be able to act as Smart Traders/Brokers, so DEX investors can rely on them to turn their trading ideas into reality by issuing asset trading contracts that work flexibly.

### Motivation (How did we come up with the idea)
SFIs have been inspired by the philosophy behind Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, which we deem to be the spark that could ignite the next generation of DApps and DAOs. 

We believe decentralized applications that are not allowing participation from the greater blockchain community into their smart contract infrastructures are overlooking the real purposes for which smart contracts were invented.

## How to use SFIs
Smart Traders/Brokers should be able to submit their own SFIs by implementing any abstract standards they might desire.
```
contract LeveragedPosition is Collateralized, Position {
  // some cool stuff
}
```
